# Vite with React-TS Tailwind - React Router Template

This is a template I use for all my projects.
It also uses [bun.sh](https://bun.sh) as toolchain and package manager.

# Commands

- `bun dev` - Start dev server
- `bun build` - Build for production
- `bun preview` - Serve production build
- `bun lint` - Run ESLint
- `bun format` - Run Prettier

# How to use it?
To get started you can use the following command:
```bash
bun create Im-Fran/vite-react-ts-tailwind-router-template <project-name>
```
This will clone this repo, replace the name of the project in package.json and install bun dependencies. (Shouldn't take more than a few seconds if you have a fast connection)
